A lab environment consisting of a home server, a couple of switches, a wifi access point, router and firewall.

* Homeserver:

	Proxmox is installed on the homeserver and runs the following services as of today:
	* NAS (Network Attached Storage)
	* Jellyfin
	* Opnsense
	* PiHole

* Network:

	* The backbone of the network is 2.5G ready
	* Opnsense - Router, firewall 
	* Different WiFi networks for trusted and untrusted devices

Future plans: Setup a test AD environment, SIEM and many more things. Don't forget to follow me on [X (formerly twitter)](https://x.com/Dev_mashru) to stay updated.

PS: This was also my first PC build!

Update 1: You can read my [2024 homelab roundup blog](/blogs/my-2024-homelab-roundup/) for details on how my network is configured and all the services I am running.
