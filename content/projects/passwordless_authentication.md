A switch from the traditional, most common form of authentication used today based on something-we-know, commonly passwords to someone-who-we-are was developed. The solution makes use of biometrics, mostly fingerprint to authenticate a user. It makes use of Android smartphones with fingerprint sensor.

An Android application using Kotlin and Android Studio was created to demonstrate the same.
